Alex Edits:
        add more [projects] if you can
        runda page 2 to last page, show persona in the beginning
        show construction of bags (pack and bike bag)
        show materials too
        Halo: show pictures of the show
        write more about yourself
        [x] resume text is full width on the page, normal margins?
        change qualifications to skills (qualifications more like certifications)
        And for Work/Volunteer, should be Experiences, and  have work and volunteer as Sub-Headers

        Projects:
                add one more project 
                sketching both alone and for projects 
                portfolio: showing like exactly the same thing
                [^] portfolio  [o] resume: just have them be downloads
                like how each title has its own color
                white backgrounds don't look cohesive with the rest of the layout
                backpack, guy in a real environment: blur out the environment
                same with the handlebar bag
                suggestion: blurred background that works with the product, all united
                last two colors: stool and mug: too similar
        Mysterious:
                the way they're displayed is fine, make them a bit more mysterious (in a way)
                wheelchair one is good, because you see it in the environment
                don't like runda, should have one page that you see, not other stuff on the first page
                Insulated Mug: either the hand one or the big one as the big image 
                more focused, break it out later
                don't want to click on it because I feel like I know what it is already
        Site Layout:
                title needs to have some kind of pop out color | divvy it up
                really likes the contact page
                like the hover over the projects, maybe omit the title; the mystery in it
                don't sell too much right off the bat

Project Details:
        I feel like you could use some more info on your backpack and bike pouch. 
        you give a very detailed account for the bike stool which I feel like is your weakest design 
            ( no offense, not saying it's a bad design, just saying in comparison to your other ones not the one you should show case the most).
        your backpack and bike out I feel you can show off more and you should do so.

TWW Edits:
        tweak it for different people
        emphasis on different projects for different applications
        l in volume looks fully
        light stuff a bit too light
        consistent name
        specific skills in each thing/volunteer

Visual Language:
        uniformity and continuity
        eg Ash Stool project
        integrate with website more, less than just slides
        reduce file size a bit, loads slowly (just on Natasha A's laptop wifi)
