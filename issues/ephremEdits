add one more project or make it even and take out one of the projects
have something that illustrates my sketching ability in a project
--have sketching

the way they're displayed is fine, make them a bit more mysterious (in a way)

wheelchair one is good, because you see it in the environment

don't like runda, should have one page that you see, not other stuff on the first page

Insulated Mug: either the hand one or the big one as the big image 

more focused, break it out later

don't want to click on it because I feel like I know what it is already

portfolio: showing like exactly the same thing

portfolio and resume: just have them be downloads

like how each title has its own color

white backgrounds don't look cohesive with the rest of the layout

backpack, guy in a real environment: blur out the environment
same with the handlebar bag

suggestion: blurred background that works with the product, all united

last two colors: stool and mug: too similar

title needs to have some kind of pop out color | divvy it up

really likes the contact page

like the hover over the projects, maybe omit the title; the mystery in it
don't sell too much right off the bat
