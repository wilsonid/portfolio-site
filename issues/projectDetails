I feel like you could use some more info on your backpack and bike pouch. you give a very detailed account for the bike stool which I feel like is your weakest design ( no offense, not saying it's a bad design, just saying in comparison to your other ones not the one you should show case the most) . your backpack and bike out I feel you can show off more and you should do so.
